# Abandonware
*/əˈbandənwɛː/*<br/>
~~computer software that is no longer distributed or supported by the developer or copyright holder~~<br/>
A phone application tailored to boosting productivity by slowly providing visual clues when a user is using applications they designated beforehand
### You get the point.
Abandonware was born after it was noticed that there was a significant gap in the productivity applications market, with extremely intrusive apps on the other and not-intrusive-enough apps on the other (no indication of having accessed a banned app, you only find out when going on the productivity app). In order to stay productive on my phone, I wanted to instantly know I was on an app I wasn't supposed to be on, but without the app being brutally closed with no chance of accessing it. Thus, I came up with the idea for Abandonware as a new form of productivity app.<br/>
#### The solution?
A slow but constant visual overlay on the phone screen every time you go somewhere you're not supposed to. My chosen visual indicator was vines growing over the screen, for that gradual effect of filling the screen and preventing usage of the app after a while but also because it emphasises the idea of your productive work being abandoned and your productive live going into a state of disrepair.
## Current features
Sadly abandonware is still a work in progress, so it's not fully functional as of yet.
Things that are working, however, include:
 - Adaptative list of applications installed on the phone, with your choices remembered by the app and displayed again later. You can now select Netflix in the app, even if it won't do anything (yet!).
 - Time & Date selection when choosing to activate a block. This includes limiting the range of times to those after the current time, so unfortunately this app doesn't work for time travellers.
 - Now once you select a time for your app block, it will disable the activation button and display a timer counting down to the set time. Once the time is up, the button will enable once again.
 - A giant green overlay appears over the screen when you access an app you're not supposed to. Not the gradual transition promised but I'm getting there.
