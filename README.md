# Abandonware
*/əˈbandənwɛː/*<br/>
~~Computer software that is no longer distributed or supported by the developer or copyright holder~~<br/>
~~Whatever the hell I want, not like you're gonna check~~  
A phone application tailored to boosting productivity by slowly providing visual clues when a user is using applications they designated beforehand
### You get the point.
Abandoneware was born after it was noticed that there was a significant gap in the productivity applications market, with extremely intrusive apps on the other and not-intrusive-enough apps on the other (no indication of having accessed a banned app, you only find out when going on the productivity app).<br/>
#### The solution?
A slow but constant visual overlay on the phone screen every time you go somewhere you're not supposed to. Our chosen visual indicator was vines, first because it looks cool, but second because it emphasises the idea of something being left abandoned (say, your homework that was due in YESTERDAY), hence the name abandonware.
## Current features
Sadly abandonware is still a work in progress, so it's not fully functional as of yet.
Things that are working, however, include:
 - Adaptative list of applications installed on the phone, with your choices remembered by the app and displayed again later. You can now select Netflix in the app, even if it won't do anything (yet)!
 - Time & Date selection when choosing to activate a block. This includes limiting the range of times to those after the current time, so unfortunately this app doesn't work for time travellers. Sorry :(
 - THE FINAL COUNTDOWN! Now once you select a time for your app block, it will disable the activation button and display a timer counting down to the set time. Once the time is up, the button will enable once again. Epic.
